      //- Use the Pug `each` iterator to create a projet img, title and link in the markup for each of the projects you are showcasing.  
      each item in data.projects 
        .cell
          a(href='project/' + item.id)
            img.thumbnail(src=item.image_urls[0].landing)
            h5= item.project_name
//- the first line in the loop creates a cell then an anchor tag is created with the json files id then an image url from the joson file is injected. Finally, the project name is laced underneath the picture
      //- Use a combination of interpolation and template literals as needed to dynamically generate the the routes in the href, as well as the img's src and the projects title.
      
      //- Here's what the Pug for each project example should look like.
